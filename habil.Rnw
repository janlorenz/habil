\textbf{Systemic effects} are system-wide effects which are triggered through local interaction. 
That means, systemic effects in a system can not be boiled down to a simple aggregate of properties of its units but only to more complex ones. 
The understanding of systemic effects in socio-economic systems is crucial for good anticipation of potential societal change and the proper design of societal institutions. 
Entanglement and understanding of some relations of microscopic action and interaction and macroscopic effects is the core contributions of this habilitation. 

Studying potential systemic effects scientifically requires a well-suited description of the units of a system and their action and interaction. 
For socio-economic systems that means the development of an agent-based model with humans (or organisations or humans) as the agents. 
\textbf{Agent-based models} are studied with computer simulation. 
The work flow and how it is used to tackle political science research questions is the subject of \textcite{Lorenz2012ZurMethodeder} which is part of the habilitation work.

The basis of simulation is formal modeling, which is to map the real world in a simplifying way to a mathematical framework and ultimately into an algorithm to be implemented for simulation. 

The actions and interactions of agents in the model are defined through behavioral rules which are usually modeled in a simple direct way and not necessarily based on utility maximization. This distinguishes agent-based models from game-theoretic ones which are based on rational choice decision making. 
Agents in typical agent-based models apply these rules repeatedly in response to the changing societal context they observe. 
The idea of rational-choice models is that rational actors anticipate the potential rational moves of others which implies that all immediately switch to rational play such that action form a certain type of game-theoretic equilibrium. In game-theory, the existance and uniqueness of equilibrium solutions is of first interest and not so much, if and how an equilibrium is reached and which if this is not uniqueness. 

Some agent-based modelers therefore emphasize that they are able to study systems dynamics ``out of equilibrium''.  
Although the dynamical perspective is indeed lacking to a large extent in rational choice theories like game theory, the oppositional view of agent-based and rational choice models is mostly overstated.
First, every dynamical model -- also with the simplest behavioral rules -- has the tendency to approach attractive fixed points (equilibria), either static, stochastic, cyclic, or chaotic.  
Second, behavioral rules can often be derived from properly designed utility functions which agents maximize or satisfice. The utility maximizing and the behavioral rules framework are thus not necessary contrary but can be identical. This is further discussed in \textcite{Lorenz2012ZurMethodeder}.

Finally, game theoretic reasoning can also be fed into a dynamical agent-based model through an evolutionary or boundedly rational setting, where actors do rational-choice decision only with respect to information from a smaller subset players and anticipate only with a limited time horizon. In that sense, also rational-choice models give rise to systemic effects which go beyond the scope of the individual. 

\textcite{Groeber.Lorenz.ea2014Dissonanceminimizationas} (another part of the habilitation work) show an example how behavioral rules in models of continuous opinion dynamics can be microfounded as short-sighted (or myopic) best response of an individual to minimize opinion dissonance within its social context. In particular, the paper shows under what conditions of the dissonance function, dissonance minimization can serve as a microfoundation of averaging as the behavioral rule in opinion dynamics models. In that sense, agents in many opinion dynamics models appear as boundedly rational agents which links agent-based modeling back to decision and game theory. 
\smallskip 

In this habilitation work, agent-based modeling is either theory-driven (two works) or partly data-driven (four works).
\textbf{Theory-driven modeling} starts with a plausible setup of variables, parameters and microscopic behavioral rules. 
\textbf{Data-driven modeling} starts with the exploration of observation data by the extraction of interesting non-trivial stylized macroscopic facts. 
Either way, the idea is to explain macroscopic phenomana through human interaction on the microscopic level. 
Models always simplify the real-world therefore in some sense every model is wrong in capturing reality. The art of modeling lies in the selection of relevant aspects in relevant relations such that the phenomena of interest are captured most appropriate by few variables and few parameters. 

Lastly, systemic effects in social systems are also explored through controlled \textbf{group experiments} (four works).

When individuals form opinions on certain topics these are based on the one hand on individual knowledge, experience, and emotions, but on the other hand opinions are to a large extent intrinsically social. 
We as citizens, employees, consumers, and in other roles adjust our existing opinions once we hear the opinions of others because we learn new information, because we want to conform with, or confront the opinions of others. Sometimes we consciously might form our opinions entirely based on how it best fits in the opinion landscapes of our social environment (see \textcite{Groeber.Lorenz.ea2014Dissonanceminimizationas}). 

How individuals adjust their opinions with respect to messages from others has been studied in \emph{social psychology} in the field of \emph{attitude research}.
The focus of the \emph{opinion dynamics} goes beyond the individual and studies the effect which the repeated simultaneous opinion formation and opinion adjustments transforms and shapes the entire opinion landscape. Thus, opinion dynamics extends the view from individual processes to systemic processes triggered by them.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CHAPTER 2, TOPIC 1, Tipping Diffusivity %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Tipping diffusivity and why more links can lead to less consensus.} The first habilitation work on opinion dynamics is another theoretical contribution: \textcite{Shin.Lorenz2010TippingDiffusivityin}. 
We model a situation of two equally sized communities of agents which both are characterized by a typical number of intra-community links between agents of the same community and a typically lower number of inter-community links of members from different communities. 
All agents hold an opinion which is a real numbers between -1 and +1. It might represent a tendency towards different opposing cultures, while zero represents no opinion on this. 
Our point of analysis is to further assume that initially all agents of each community hold the same opinion, while 
one community has a negative one, and the other a positive one. 
``Negative'' and ``positive'' are used in the mathematical sense here, abstracting from any value judgment. 
Our theoretical question is under what conditions on the amount and ratio of intra- vs. inter-community links can these communities maintain their different opinions. 

The opinion dynamics is modeled as an information accumulation system \parencite{Shin2009Informationaccumulationsystem}. Information means here opinion towards one of the two opposites -1 or +1. In each iteration agents on the one hand forget part of that information (which would imply convergence to the ground state zero) and accumulate on the other hand opinions of the agents within their network which includes many agents from the same community and few agents from the other community. As we assume that all agents start with the same opinion as the others in their community and all have the same amount of intra- and inter-community links, their opinions will always move synchronously and we can study just two dynamical equations as $y_1$ and $y_2$ for the opinion in each community. 
The global variables of the model are: the intra-community diffusivity $\Omega_0$, the inter-community diffusivity $\Omega_X$, and the rate of forgetting $\Delta$ (diffusivities are uniformly derived from the number of intra- and inter-community links). The dynamical equations and their derivation from the agent-based model are shown in \textcite{Shin.Lorenz2010TippingDiffusivityin}. 

We are able to completely characterize the dynamics of this system, including all fixed points, their status of attractivity and stability, and their basins of attraction. Figure \ref{fig:ShinLorenz} shows a phase diagram with respect to intra- and inter-community diffusivities. It shows which fixed points of which kind exist in which regions of the phase space.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/fig2_3_blog-crop.pdf}
\caption{Phase diagram of intra- vs. inter-community diffusivity $(\Omega_0,\Omega_X)$ parameterized by the rate of forgetting $\Delta$ (top), with five exemplary $(y_1,y_2)$-planes which show the fixed points for the opinions of the two communities and their basins of attraction for different initial opinions (center), and with ten exemplary trajectories over time for different initial opinions (periphery). } \label{fig:ShinLorenz}
\end{figure}

The most interesting prediction of the model is summarized in the title of the paper: ``More links, less consensus''. This result can be best understood by following the red arrow in Figure \ref{fig:ShinLorenz}. This arrow represents situations where there are always four times more intra-community links than inter-community links but along the arrow the total number of links for each agent increases. The phase diagram is parameterized in units of the rate of forgetting. When we follow the arrow diffusivity increases (under constant ratio intra vs. inter) with respect to the rate of forgetting. The ``travel'' goes as follows:
\begin{compactenum}[(1)]
 \item Initially we are in the trivial zone. The rate of forgetting dominates and trajectories converge to the ground state or ``no opinion'' for any initial opinions. 
 \item We cross the border to the consensus zone. Now two fixed points emerge, and both communities converge to a either a positive or a negative opinion. The system converges to the opinion of the community starting with the more extreme opinion. It is still possible for the system to converge to the ground state but only for a thin set of initial values (shown as a white diagonal line). This is a typical example of an unstable but attractive fixed point. 
 \item We cross the dotted line and are still in the consensus zone, but two unstable fixed points with coexisting different opinions in communities emerge. Even the smallest fluctuation in opinions around these fixed points of coexistence would bring the system to the basin of attractio of one of the two consensual fixed points. 
 \item We cross the border to the coexistence zone where both coexistence fixed point become stable. The further we go the larger their basins of attraction grow. 
\end{compactenum}
One reason for the emergence of the coexistence zone that the dynamical equation has a saturation component which prevents that agents accumulate information in one direction ad infinitum. Information saturates at either +1 or -1, which seems like a reasonable assumption.

A hypothesis which one can derive from this model is that coexistence of different cultures in connected communities is more likely when the overall connectivity is larger. We think that this might be part of an explanation for the increasing polarization and fragmentation of political debates which seems to happen nowadays through increasing  connectivity through social networks on the internet. The next step should be to bring this hypothesis to an empirical test. 

\bigskip

The following three parts of the habilitation are data-driven modeling works on different types of opinions. We start with a model of party attachment over the life-span of people, continue with a model to explain histograms of movie ratings and conclude with a first attempt to use a version of the bounded confidence model to explain opinion landscapes and from the European Social Survey. Every description therefore starts with a brief description of the stylized facts observed in data. 

\bigskip


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CHAPTER 2, PAPER 2, Political Partisanship %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{How political partisanship forms through self-reinforcement.} The \textcite{GSPS2010datayears1984-2010} asked their participants if they feel attached to a certain party and to which. Despite of panel attrition and other exclusion criteria, an impressive number of 965 individuals remain which unambiguously name either no attachement or attachment to one of the four West-German political parties (CDU/CSU, SPD, FDP, Grüne) in every of the 27 years from 1984 to 2010. 
Figure \ref{fig:MetzLorenz} is a histogram of these 965 individuals showing how many individuals made which amounts of announcement for a left (SPD and Grüne) and right (CDU/CSU and FDP) party. In particular, the histogram shows, that there are about 100 people who made 27 announcements of attachments to a left party (leftmost bin). Also about 100 people announced 27 times an attachment to a right party (rightmost bin). About 40 people never announced any party attachment (most backward bin). People announcing an attachment toa left (right) party but not all the time exist in large magnitude. People who announce a large number announcements for left and right parties are rare. For example there is only one person which announced eleven times a left party and also eleven times a right party. This histogram is modeled in \textcite{Metz.Lorenz2013Becomewhoyou}. 

\begin{figure}[tb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/3dPlotSideChoice_qti.pdf}
\caption{Histogram indicating the count of individuals announcing attachment with left (SPD, Grüne) and right (CDU/CSU, FDP) parties. (This 3d bar-plot matches Figure 1 (Left) in \textcite{Metz.Lorenz2013Becomewhoyou}.)} \label{fig:MetzLorenz}
\end{figure}

The main stylized facts of this data are: 
\begin{compactenum}[(i)]
 \item Party attachment is almost exclusively either to right or to left parties. The decision of an individual is thus mostly if the left (or right) attachement is announced or not and not which of the two sides is chosen. 
 \item The histogram (count of people) of the number of uttered attachment within a time interval (here 27 years) has a U-shape. That means, there are peaks at the extremes for no attachment ever (0 announcments) and always attached (27 announcments), and further on there are more people close to these extremes than for an intermediate number of announcements.  
\end{compactenum}

The paper presents a stochastic model for the utterance of party attachments by individuals over time. 
Based on, stylized fact 1. we decided to neglect the left-right divide and concentrate on the homing-in and homing-out process. The dynamic variable for each individual over the 27 years is thus if she or he utters an attachment or not. The U-shape leads us to assume some self-reinforcing for utterance and non-utterance over time. 

Our model idea is the following: 
We focus on the individual and its memory of past announcements of party attachments. 
In year one an individual announces a party attachment with probability $0 \leq q \leq 1$. 
In year two this individual announces a party attachment with probability $\frac{q}{2}$ if it had not announced an attachment before and with probability $\frac{q+1}{2}$ if it had announced one. 
The probability of an announcement is thus more likely if an announcement happened before. 

For a generic mechanism we define $x(t) \in \{0,1\}$ to be the \emph{announcement of the individual} at time step $t$, $\bar{x}(t) = \sum_{s=1}^t x(t)$ as the \emph{number of announcements} up to $t$, and $q$ as the \emph{interest in politics}. 
We define the \emph{probability to announce a partisanship} at time $t$ as $p(t,\bar{x}(t),q) = \frac{\bar{x}(t) + q}{t+1}$. 
Consequently $x(t+1)=1$ with probabilty $p(t,\bar{x}(t),q)$ and x(t+1) = 0 otherwise. 
The stochastic process $(x(t))_{t}$ is thus not a Markov process as the transition probabilities depends not only on the latest state but on all past states. 
The analog process $(\bar{x}(t))_t$ instead is a time-dependent Markov process, because $\bar{x}(t+1) = \bar{x}(t) + 1$ with probability $p(t,\bar{x}(t),q)$ and $\bar{x}(t+1) = \bar{x}(t)$ otherwise. Here, the transition probabilities only depned on the current state and the time step. 
This evolution of the probability distribution of the number of announcements $\bar{x}(t)$ can be easily computed by iteratively multiplying the time-dependent transition matrices of the Markov process. 
Figure \ref{fig:MetzLorenz2} shows how the probability distribution evolves for $q=0.641$. 

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/EvolutionOfMarkovChain.pdf}
\caption{Evolution the interactive Markov chain for the probability distribution of the numbers of attachments in 0, 1, 2, ..., 10 years. (Plot is not in \textcite{Metz.Lorenz2013Becomewhoyou}.)} \label{fig:MetzLorenz2}
\end{figure}

Theoretically, it turns out the distribution of the number of announcements after $t$ time steps is Beta-binomial distribution for $t$ trials with $\alpha = q$ and $\beta = 1-q$. 
Another way to see the model is as a kind of urn model: Each announcement as a random draw from the urn where all  past announcements and non-announcements are represented by balls with two different colors plus one additional special ball which shows the announcements color with probability $q$ and the non-announcement color with probability $1-q$. 

<<Test_Beta_Binomial, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hide'>>=
n <- 10
a <- 0.641
b <- 1-a
K <- 0:n
bb <- choose(n,K) * beta(K + a, n - K + b)/beta(a,b)
plot(K,bb*100,ylim=c(0,100))
@

We fitted the model parameter $q$ to best match the data and received $q=0.641$. The model fit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:MetzLorenz3}. The model fit has a striking coefficient of determination of $R^2 = 0.958$ (not reported in the paper). This shows that the idea to model announcements of party attachment as a self-re-inforcing stochastic process already explains the evolving U-shaped distribution quite well. In particular, it explains with just one global parameter -- the interest in politics $q$ -- the co-existence of large fractions non- and strong partisans and smaller fraction of individuals which home-in and home-out of their party attachment.  

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/ParameterFit.pdf}
\caption{Fit between SOEP data and theory (q = 0.641) for number of at-
tachments. Data from Markov chain, confidence intervals from 1000 runs

of the panel. (This plot matches Figure 2 (Left) in \textcite{Metz.Lorenz2013Becomewhoyou}.)} \label{fig:MetzLorenz3}
\end{figure}

For smaller interest in politics $q<0.641$ the distribution would lead to a U-shape with a higher amount of never attached and a lower amount of always attached individuals. For higher interest in politics $q<0.641$ the bin with always attached individuals would be even higher and the bin with never attached individuals even lower. In the paper, we analysed if this would realize when we subdivide our sample based on the survey question about individuals' political interest in the \textcite{GSPS2010datayears1984-2010}. It turns out that fitting the model parameter $q$ for the different subsamples of people gives us $q=0.82$ for individuals with very strong political interest, $q=0.7$ for strong, $q=0.58$ for weak, and $q=41$ for no interest in politics.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CHAPTER 2, TOPIC 3, Movie ratings %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Average and deviate -- how movie rating histograms take shape.} 

Nowadays, $\bigstar$-based rating systems are ubiquitous. Almost everything can be rated with some $\bigstar$'s. The costs of rating is just one click. Movies gain several 10,000 or even 100,000 ratings on popular sites. The ``Internet Movie Database'' (\url{IMDb.com} uses a 10$\bigstar$-scale. Of most interest to users is the average number of $\bigstar$s, which is prominently displayed in the website. This number influences the decisions of other to watch the movie. Further on, the user-movie-matrix of ratings is the basis for personalized recommendation systems. Besides the average, also the histogram of the number of $\bigstar$s is accessible. \textcite{Lorenz2009Universalityofmovie} analyzes histograms of all movies with more than 20,000 ratings\footnote{These were 1,086 movies by March 2008. For an impression of the trend: By Sep 6, 2016 IMDb has 1,403 titles with more than 100,000 votes. This includes series now.}, and tries to identify universal characteristics which say something about underlying processes of continuous opinion dynamics. 10$\bigstar$-rating scales are a good approximation of continuous opinions because ratings are adjustable and fairly fine-grained. 

The main stylized facts are:
\begin{compactenum}[(i)]
\item Histograms have {`Gaussian-like'} shape on the central bins (2$\bigstar$--9$\bigstar$). That means there is only one peak and the decay when deviating from the peak looks like a Gaussian.
\item {Extreme} bins (1$\bigstar$ and $10\bigstar$) are higher than expected from extrapolating the Gaussian-like shape on central bins.
\end{compactenum}
Consequently, movie histograms have either three or two peaks. When there are three peaks two are at the extremes. When there are two peaks one or both are at the extremes. There are only 5 movies (0.5\%) exemptions\footnote{In 4 cases the 2$\bigstar$-bin is slightly higher than 3$\bigstar$-bin but less than the 1$\bigstar$-bin. One movie has an almost invisible additional peak at the 3$\bigstar$-bin.} Nine examples are shown in Figure \ref{fig:IMDbexamples}.
These observations contradict assumptions on the shape from the literature: for example the uniform, U-like, or single-peaked shape. These assumptions were either made ad hoc for theoretical reasons, or on the basis of data on the coarser grained 5$\bigstar$-scale.

\caption{Nine movie rating histogram examples from IMDb together with a corresponding $\mu$-fitted confined Levy-skew $\alpha$-stable histogram (red lines).} \label{fig:IMDbexamples}
\end{figure}

Both stylized facts are explained through two assumptions on the process of opinion formation:
\begin{compactenum}[I.]
\item A ratings is the average of opinions of others, the current average rating, or several criteria which we assume to be independent random variables. Thus, the distribution of ratings has a Gaussian-like shape due to the central limit theorem.
\item Ratings are {discretised and confined} continuous opinions. All probability mass which lies beyond the rating scale has to be collected in the extremal bins.
\end{compactenum}
The idea off II. is that individuals might want to assess a movie as 15$\bigstar$ or -1$\bigstar$ but have to confine their estimate between 1$\bigstar$ and 10$\bigstar$. Regarding I., the only distribution which evolves under averaging in the limit of many criteria is the \emph{L\'evy skew $\alpha$-stable distribution} $S(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\mu)$. Thus, it is a natural candidate to characterise rating histograms. 
Its probability density function is
\begin{displaymath}
  P(x) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}
\varphi (t)
  e^{-itx}\,dt, \quad \varphi(t) = e^{\mu\!-\!|\gamma t|^\alpha\,(1\!-\!i\beta\,\textrm{sign}(t)\Phi)}.
\end{displaymath}
with $\Phi = \tan(\frac{\pi\alpha}{2})$ if $\alpha\neq 1$ and $\Phi=-\frac{2}{\pi}\log |t|$ for $\alpha=1$.
Parameters characterise  $\alpha \in (0,2]$ {peakedness}, $\beta \in [-1,1]$ {skewness}, $\gamma \in [0,\infty)$ {scale} (or dispersion), and $\mu \in (-\infty,\infty)$ {location} of the distribution of opinions as shown in Figure \ref{fig:levy}.
The normal distribution comes out for $\alpha=2$, in this case $\beta$ has no effect. For $\alpha<2$ the distribution has power-law tails which decay on both sides as $P(x) \propto |x|^{-(1+\alpha)}$. The mean of the distribution exists for $\alpha>1$ and is $\mu$. The generalized central limit theorem states that the average of several random variables which distributiona have power law tails with the same exponent converge to a L\'evy skew $\alpha$-stable distribution. From a continuous L\'evy skew $\alpha$-stable distribution, a \emph{confined $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\mu)$-histogram} of ratings can be produced by discretisation as shown in Figure \ref{fig:discretization}.

\end{figure}

With a procedure documented in the paper, confined $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\mu)$-histograms were fitted to the empirical IMDb-histograms. Figure \ref{fig:LevyParams} shows how the fitted $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are distributed with respect to $\mu$. The figure shows that the smallest scale parameter $\gamma$ as well as no skewness ($\beta=0$) appear both for $\mu\approx 7.5$ which coincides with the overall average $\mu$. Further on, the peakedness $\alpha$
is relatively constant at around $\frac{4}{3}$ with respect to $\mu$. Skewness shows a linear trend with movies better than average being left-skew and movies worse than average being right skew. That means, better movies even have a fatter tail in the very good ratings, while bad movies have a fatter tail in the bad ratings. The scale parameter increases in a parabolic form when deviting from the average rating. That mean non-average movies show more dispresion. Form these regularities -- linear $\beta$, quadratic $\gamma$, and constant $\alpha$ -- a one-parameter fit called {$\mu$-fit} was constructed and all movies where fitted again by only using the parameter $\mu$. The other three parameters of the confined $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\mu)$-histograms are just functions of $\mu$ corresponding to the green lines in Figure \ref{fig:LevyParams}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics[width=0.32\columnwidth]{/home/janlo/Documents/posters/2009_Rome/figs/figLevyParams1}

\end{figure}

The $\mu$-fit in comparison to the original empirical histograms is shown for the nine example movies in Figure \ref{fig:IMDbexamples}. Over all the quality of the one parameter fit is impressive. The average coefficient of determination $R^2$ is 0.943.

In conclusion see ratings as discretised and confined pre-averaged continuous opinions leads to very good approximations of real-world rating histograms. The underlying {opinion distribution is not normal but fat-tailed}. The one-parameter $\mu$-fit is still good and shows surprising regularities: an average movie ($\mu\approx 7.5$) has most narrow distribution and no skewness. Deviation from an average movie makes the opinion distribution broader and skew pronouncing the deviation. The surprising accuracy achieved with a non-trival model but only one parameter points to strong non-trivial regularities in the process of opinion formation for movie ratings.
Despite these indication of universality, the results can also be used to {characterise movies} in a new way by quantifying the differences from theoretical histograms with a given quality.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CHAPTER 2, TOPIC 4, Ideology Landscapes %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{How clusters in ideology space emerge through opinion dynamics under bounded confidence.} 


My dissertation \textcite{Lorenz2007RepeatedAveragingand, Lorenz2006Consensusstrikesback,Lorenz2006ContinuousOpinionDynamics,Lorenz2008ManagingComplexityInsights} and derived works \parencite{Lorenz2007ContinuousOpinionDynamics,Lorenz2010Heterogeneousboundsof} have extensively studied the bounded confidence model of continuous opinion dynamics through agent-based simulation as well as through numerical integration of its density-based description. These were theoretical works. \textcite{Lorenz2015ModelingEvolutionIdeological} (part of the habilitation work) is a first attempt to apply the model ``as is'' to explain the shape of real-world opinion landscapes in the political/ideological realm.

The data we use is from two items of the European Social Survey \parencite{ESS6}. People from a representative sample are asked for their ideological left---right selfplacement with the question ``In politics people sometimes talk of `left' and `right'. Using this card, where would you place yourself on this scale, where 0 means the left and 10 means the right?'' They are asked about European unification with the question ``Now thinking about the European Union, some say European unification should go further. Others say it has already gone too far. Using this card, what number on the scale best describes your position? [0=`Unification has already gone too far', 10=`Unification should go further']''. Figure \ref{fig:ess} shows histograms of answers over the samples in France, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom using the design weights provided by ESS. These weights correct for different selection probabilities triggered by the sampling design. We call such histograms \emph{ideology} or \emph{opinion landscapes}. 

These (and the other) opininon landscapes show the following stylized Facts:
\begin{compactenum}
 \item They never show the characteristics of a simple distribution, like the normal, uniform, or beta distribution. 
 \item The largest peak is always central.
 \item Multiple peaks are almost ubiquitous.
 \item Very often peaks at the extremes exist.
 \item Often there are intermediate off-center peaks e.g at 3 or 4 and 7 or 8.
\end{compactenum}

\end{figure}

We try to reproduce these stylized facts with the model bounded confidence model (the name goes back to \textcite{Hegselmann.Krause2002OpinionDynamicsand}) in the version with dyadic communication as in \textcite{Deffuant.Neau.ea2000MixingBeliefsamong} including random opinion replacements (called ``reconsideration'' by \textcite{Lorenz2015ModelingEvolutionIdeological}), operationalized as noise following \textcite{Pineda.Toral.ea2009Noisycontinuous-opiniondynamics}. 

In short, the model is about $N$ agents (e.g. $N=1000$) which opinions are numbers from the interval $[0,1]$, which represent a continuous version of the 11-point scale from the ESS. Initially, the opinion of an agent is a random draw from a uniform distribution on the interval $[0,1]$. The opinions of agents are subject to change over time because they communicate with others. All agents are further equipped with a homogeneous \emph{bound of confidence} $\varepsilon$ also from the range [0,1] which is not subject to change but determines the maximal ideological distance to others which an agent is willing to take into account to revise its ideological position. 
We consider agents to change their ideological positions because of two processes: \emph{adaptation under bounded confidence} and \emph{random opinion replacement}. 
For each agent $i$ and each time step opinion adaptation happens with probability $1-m$ and opinion replacement happens otherwise. In the case of adaptation, another agent $j$ is picked at random. Agent $i$ interacts with it only when their distance in opinion is less than its bound of confidence $|x_i(t) - x_j(t)| < \varepsilon$. If agent $j$ is close enough agent $i$ changes its ideological position to the average of the two positions $x_i(t+1) = (x_i(t) + x_j(t))/2$. In case of opinion replacement, agent $i$ does not engage in interaction with others but reconsiders its ideological position from scratch, that mean it chooses a new random value from the interval $[0,1]$. Notice, that dynamics on the macrolevel remains unchanged if instead of picking a new random opinion the agent just switches back to its initial opinion, which was picked at random only at the beginning of the simulation. 
Some care is necessary with respect to specifics of the simulation algorithm and model parameters. In many implementation, agents $i$ and $j$ are drawn at the time and both of their opinions are updated. In this system on average there or twice as much adaptation events per agent than in the model described here where only $i$ adapts. As a consequence the model with bilateral adaptation behaves as the model with unilateral adaptation but only half of the probability for opinion replacement, while dynamics of the former are twice as fast as dynamics of the latter. Here we use unilateral adaptation, while in \textcite{Lorenz2015ModelingEvolutionIdeological} bilateral adaptation was used. Further on, \textcite{Lorenz2015ModelingEvolutionIdeological} uses $p$ for the probability of random opinion replacement, while we use $m$ here for consistency with \textcite{Pineda.Toral.ea2009Noisycontinuous-opiniondynamics}. In comparison of the results here with the results in \textcite{Lorenz2015ModelingEvolutionIdeological} it thus holds $m = p/2$.

The model is implemented in NetLogo \parencite{Wilensky1999NetLogo} for easy use \parencite{TODO}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:snap1} shows the full screen of the Netlogo model (in a different design changed design compared to \textcite{Lorenz2012ContinuousOpinionDynamics} as cited in \textcite{Lorenz2015ModelingEvolutionIdeological}). 
The main panel in the center shows the trajectories of opinions up to the current time step moving from left to right. For longer runs this panel turns into a ``roling'' display showing only the latest time steps. 
At the bottom there are two observers which accompany the central panel of trajectories. 
The left hand side panel shows the histogram of the current opinions in eleven equidistant bins, resembling the discretization of empirical opinion landscapes from the ESS. 
The right hand side panel shows the evolution of the mean and the median opinion over the full time the simulation has been running. 

\begin{sidewaysfigure}

 \caption{Full screen of the Netlogo model of \textcite{TODO}. A run is shown for 500 agents with homogeneous bound of confidence $\varepsilon=0.25$ and without reconsideration ($m=0$).}\label{fig:snap1}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

To understand model dynamics, let us first look at homogeneous bounds of confidence without noise ($m=0$). 
Large bounds of confidence (approximately $\varepsilon>0.27$) lead to \emph{consensus}. Intermediate bounds of confidence (approximately $0.18<\varepsilon<0.27$) lead to \emph{polarization} into two equally large opinion clusters, one moderately left-wing and one moderately right-wing. Small bounds of confidence ($\varepsilon<0.18$) lead to \emph{plurality} of three or more clusters. Fig.~\ref{fig:homo} shows trajectories for different bounds of confidence to demonstrate consensus, polarization and plurality. These can also be checked in the NetLogo model \parencite{TODO} through special example buttons.

\end{figure}

% The dynamical process towards stable polarization over time runs as follows: (i) Starting with initially uniformly distributed opinions, central agents (with opinions more than $\varepsilon$ away from the boundary) are equally likely to find a close enough communication partner at either side. Extremal agents close to the boundary of the opinion space instead can only find close enough communication partners slightly more central. Thus they will move closer to the center, but at most $\varepsilon/2$ as they ignore others when they are farther then $\varepsilon$ away. (ii) After a few timesteps this leads to a slightly higher concentration of agents in the region [$\varepsilon/2$,$\varepsilon$] and the opposing region on the other side of the opinion space. The concentration of agents remains the same in the center and declined at the extremes. Now, an agent between the center and $\varepsilon$ has a higher chance to find a close enough communication partner at the other side of the center because the 
% concentration of agents is higher there. Thus, it is more likely that it moves from the center towards the region of higher concentration. The same happens on the other side of the opinion space. (iii) Regions of slightly higher concentration quickly gain higher concentration through this kind of attraction. Regions of high concentration finally converge to opinion clusters which have a distance of about $2\varepsilon$. 

% Similar arguments explain the evolution of more clusters for lower bounds of confidence. Of course, the random initial conditions and the random selection of communication partners can lead to different outcomes, but even for relatively low numbers of agents the separation between consensus and polarization as attractive final opinion landscapes is quite sharp at the critical value $\varepsilon=0.27$. This means that random influence decides which of the two attractive landscapes will be reached when the bound of confidence is at such a critical value. When the bound of confidence is far away from a critical value it is almost sure that always the same pattern of clustered opinion landscape is reached. 
% 
% The typical locations bifurcating at the critical values into more and more clusters are shown in a bifurcation diagram in \textcite{Lorenz2007ContinuousOpinionDynamics}. Note, that in this study we ignore minor clusters of minimal size which structurally emerge at the extremes and between the major clusters, because they usually contain only zero to two agents in the sample sizes we use. 
% 
% From a political science perspective the view on the mean and the median opinion is interesting (see upper right panel in the model's full screen in Fig.~\ref{fig:snap1}). In uniformly distributed opinions mean and median are of course almost the same. Interestingly, in the $\varepsilon$ range of polarization the median quickly starts to deviate from the mean when opinion dynamics starts. The mean remains almost central but due to the depopulation of the center the median finally ends up to be in one of the two off-central clusters far away from the compromising position in the center. Which of the two clusters ends up slightly larger than the other is subject to random fluctuation. 

Compared to the stylized facts, the model without noise is able to produce clustered opinion landscapes, but clusters are maximally pronounced peaks and not blurred peaks as we see them in the empirical opinion landscapes of the ESS data. 
The introduction of random individual reconsideration of opinions with probability $m$ blurs the peakedness of clusters such that they visually come closer to the opinion landscapes observed empirically in the ESS data. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:reconsider} shows three example trajectories in heatmap visualization and a snapshot of the histogram. As can be inferred from the trajectories, the histogram fluctuates but keeps its typical shape. The values $\varepsilon=0.15,0.25,0.3$ are taken from Fig.~\ref{fig:homo} and the values $m=0.06,0.1,0.045$ are chosen in an attempt to visually match some characteristics of ESS opinion landscapes.

\end{figure}

To what extent do opinion landscapes from the model in Fig.~\ref{fig:reconsider} match empirical opinion landscapes in Fig.~\ref{fig:data_lrtime}? Generally, no model specification is able to reproduce all stylized facts from empirical distributions. Thus, the development of a parameter fitting procedure is left for future models and the further discussion is exploratory and qualitatively. Nevertheless, the model distributions match the empirically observed distributions visually much better than any specification of a beta distribution or other standard distributions. As the model has also only two parameters $(\varepsilon,p)$ this is already a small success. 

Going along the increasing bounds of confidence from Fig.~\ref{fig:reconsider} different stylized facts of empirical distributions are reproduced by the model. 

\textbf{Closed-minded agents} (Fig.~\ref{fig:reconsider}A $\varepsilon=0.15$): Under a relatively high probability of reconsideration ($m=0.12$) an opinion landscape with three peaks is produced -- a central, a moderate left, and a moderate right cluster as we see it in many empirical landscapes; but empirical landscapes of this type usually also have extremal peaks, the moderate peaks lie a bit closer to the center and never on the bins 1 and 9 and the central peak is much more pronounced.

\textbf{Intermediate agents} (Fig.~\ref{fig:reconsider}B $\varepsilon=0.25$): Under a high probability of reconsideration ($p=0.2$) the opinion landscape is still polarized as for the non-noisy case, but clusters are blurred such that their shape and location at bins 2,3 respectively 7,8 matches moderate off-center empirical clusters. In this specification a dominant central cluster as observed empirically misses completely. If it would exist it would absorb the moderate clusters quickly. Also extremal peaks as empircally found are missing. 

\textbf{Open-minded agents} (Fig.~\ref{fig:reconsider}C $\varepsilon=0.3$): Under an intermediate probability of reconsideration ($p=0.09$) the opinion landscape shows a large central peak as observed empirically, also small peaks at the extremes match the emprical landscapes, although empirical extremal peaks lie more pronounced at 0 and 10 and not on 0,1 respectively 9,10 as in the model. The weak point here is that empirically we observe much more mass on the bins close to the center. 

In conclusion, several stylized facts can be reproduced by this two parameter model much better than classical distributions can, but the model can not produce a large central peak, and tendencies for small and blurred moderate off-center peaks and small or tiny extremal peaks at the same time in its current form. 

Agent-based models for the evolution of ideological landscapes are still in its infancy and it remains to show if they can add interesting insight to political dynamics. At least the possibility for counterfactual analysis at critical values seems promising for studying and understanding self-driven abrupt changes in political landscapes.

Growth is fundamental to all living organisms. 
 Societal growth is the growth of a societal value such as total wealth or total productivity in a society composed of individuals which act mostly independent but also interrelated through interaction or societal institutions. 
 Macroeconomic growth can be defined analogously. % TODO Check 
 Whether a society or economy experiences growth or decline, can critically depend on this coupling of individual growth process. 
 The three   two contributions to systemic effects on societal growth. 

 First, \textcite{Koenig.Lorenz.ea2016Innovationvsimitation} show how innovation together with imitation of technology optimizes productivity growth in an economy of independent firms. 
 The second contribution \parencite{Lorenz.Paetzel.ea2013Redistributionspursgrowth}, shows how redistribution of wealth through proportional taxation and redistribution as equal lump-sums can spur growth. 
 
 
 Such growth through redistribution is triggered when individual growth is proportional but rates of growth (or decline when below one) are partly stochastic. 
 The latter results poses the question if and how a democratic society is capable of realizing the desired levels of redistribution. 
 An experimental study \parencite{Lorenz.Paetzel.ea2016JustDontCall} on framing of collective decisions about redistribution shows an important aspect of the answer to this question There is a higher propensity to high tax rates  
\bigskip

\paragraph{How innovation and imitation drive growth of productivity.} \textcite{Koenig.Lorenz.ea2016Innovationvsimitation} show how innovation together with imitation of technology maximized productivity growth in an economy of firms. The theory reproduces the empirical fact that the productivity distribution of domestic firms in existing economies are travelling waves with left and right tails following power laws.

\begin{compactenum}
 \item \textbf{Information about endowments and ideally preferred decision.} Subjects were informed about their own endowments and the endowment of all other group members and about the average endowment (1700 tokens in each round). Further on, subjects were privately asked to enter their ideally preferred minimum income resp.~tax rate. Only valid values were accepted. The MIN frame instructions told subjects these were values between the endowment of the poorest group member and the average income. The TAX frame instructions stated that tax rates could be between 0\% and 100\%.
 \item \textbf{Communication stage.} Each subject had to make ten proposals which appeared in a five-column table visible to all group members. The first proposals appeared in the table after the last group member confirmed its proposal. All other proposals appeared immediately after confirmation. The endowments were displayed throughout the whole communication stage. Subjects could only communicate by numbers to coordinate their final decisions.
 \item \textbf{Collective decision stage.} After the tenth proposal, a decision box appeared where subjects had to enter their final decision privately. A group decision was achieved when at least three subjects decided for the same number (majority rule). The net income was then computed using the redistributive mechanism explained in Section 2. If the group failed to reach a collective decision, the income was either 50\% of the endowment or half of the average endowment whichever was lower.
 \item \textbf{Information payoff.} Subjects were informed about the result of the collective decision and about their total net income at the end of the sixth period. The payoff in Euro was defined by a subject's average earnings over six periods with an exchange rate of 1 experimental token = \EUR{0.005}.
\end{compactenum}

Subjects were recruited from the University of Oldenburg using the software ORSEE \parencite{Greiner2015Subjectpoolrecruitment}. Implementing a between subjects design (two sessions for each frame) and a total of four sessions with twenty subjects each, delivered a dataset of 480 individual observations, six from each subject. The dataset is publicly available % \parencite{ANONYMIZED}.

The dependent variable is the level of redistribution which we quantify as the tax rate $\tau$.  Groups decided implicitly about $\tau$ via Eq.~(\ref{eq:MINtaxrate}) in the MIN frame and directly in the TAX frame. Individuals' preferred $\tau$ is stated by subjects when they saw their own endowment, the average endowment, and the endowments of the other four members of the group, but before any communication, decision or implementation. %For the purpose of the empirical analysis $m$ has been translated into $\tau$.

 The wisdom of the crowd phenomenon is when the aggregate of several individual estimates is close to the true value although most estimates are far away from it. 
 
 The seminal example is due to one founding father of statistics, Francis Galton. At the weight-judging competition at the West of England Fat Stock and Poultry Exhibition he collected 787 cards on which competitors estimated the weight of the meat of an ox after it has been slaughtered and dressed. 
 In his paper in \emph{Nature}, \textcite{Galton1907Voxpopuli} reported that the 5-percentile and the 95-percentile spannded values from 1,074 to 1,293 pounds, while the median (middlemost) value was 1,207 which was surprisingly close to the correct value of 1,198 pounds. 
 \textcite{Galton1907Voxpopuli} concludes: \textit{``This result is, I think more credible to the trustworthiness of a democratic judgment than might have been expected.''} 

<<Galton-Data,echo=FALSE>>=
G <- c(read.csv("R/galton_data.csv",header = FALSE)[[1]])
truth_G <- 1198
@
 
 Just recently, Kenneth W. Wallis dug out the full sample of estimates from Galton's notes out of the archive and made it publically available\footnote{\url{https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/academic/wallis/publications/galton_data.xlsx}}. He also found some small errors in Galtons computation \parencite{Wallis2014RevisitingFrancisGaltons} with a 5-percentile of \Sexpr{format(quantile(G,0.05),digits=4,big.mark=",")} and a median of \Sexpr{format(median(G),big.mark=",")}. Figure \ref{fig:galton} shows the histogram of estimates together with the truth, the median and the mean of estimates. 
 
 Interestingly, the mean of estimates \Sexpr{format(mean(G), digits=5,big.mark=",")} is even more accurate than the median  which Galton reported. \textcite{Hooker1907MeanorMedian} already made that point in a letter to \emph{Nature}. He estimated the mean as 1,196 based on the percentiles reported by \textcite{Galton1907Voxpopuli} and \textcite{Galton1907Ballot-Box} reported it to be 1,197. Hooker as well as Galton referred to another paper, where \textcite{Galton1907Onevoteone} argued that for ``democratic'' aggregation always the median shall be used and not the mean, because it would give \emph{``voting power to `cranks' in proportion to their crankiness.''} Ultimately, it turns out that the arguments for using the median as democratic means against cranks has its value in its own right, although it is not of key importance in estimation tasks. The malicious power of cranks under aggregation of the mean would be to over- or understate estimates to steer the mean towards a certain direction. 
 Obviously, this does not play such an important role in guestimation games, first because there is no incentive to do, and second because the number of participants is large.

\end{figure}

 The question of mean vs. median, or -- more general -- the choice of the aggregation function can be elaborated further with another impressive example for the wisdom of the crowd phenomenon. This time it involves data in which collection I was involved. 
 The lottery ``Haste mal 'nen Euro? -- Tombola''\footnote{Meaning something like ``Would you spend one Euro? -- Tombola''.} happened at the festival ``ViertelFest'' August 22-24, 2008 in Bremen. The tombola was an ordinary one, where people could buy lots which could bring them prices. As the topic of the festival was ``Swarm Intelligence'', I asked the organizers to include a guestimation task similar to the one West of England Fat Stock and Poultry Exhibition. 
 Each buyer of a lot also got another chance to win: 
 They could estimate the number of lots which would have been sold in total during after the three days of the festival. The estimates closest to the true value got tickets for the circus. Further on, before the lottery the organizers asked an expert, the organizer of Bremen's biggest lottery (Bürgerpark-Tombola) about his estimate for reference. The data is accessible online\footnote{Blog post in German: \url{http://janlo.de/wp/2010/06/22/die-weisheit-der-bremer/}. Direct link to the data: \url{http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AqRUj58gkTakcDIybDYtYTRBOHozTDVtRkhCX1N4Rnc&hl=de&single=true&gid=0&output=csv}}. 
<<Viertelfest-Data,echo=FALSE>>=
D <- tbl_df(read.csv("R/Viertelfest.csv")) %>% mutate(Estimate=Schätzung)
sD <- D$Estimate
truth <- 10788
expert <- 19100
@
 In total, \Sexpr{format(nrow(D), big.mark=",")} estimates of the number of lots were handed in. The true value was that \Sexpr{format(truth, big.mark=",")} lots had been sold\footnote{Thus, \Sexpr{format(100*nrow(D)/truth, digits=3)}\% of the lots were used to participate in the guestimation game.}, and the expert estimated \Sexpr{format(expert, big.mark=",")} lots. 
 The 5- and 95-percentiles span values from \Sexpr{format(round(quantile(D$Schätzung,0.05)), big.mark=",")} to \Sexpr{format(round(quantile(D$Schätzung,0.95)), big.mark=",")}, and thus almost three orders of magnitude. 
 The median of estimates is \Sexpr{format(median(D$Schätzung),big.mark=",")} and comes much closer to the true value than the expert. 
 Figure \ref{fig:viertelfest} shows the truth, the experts estimate, the mean\footnote{The arithmetic mean is meant here. }, the median and the histogram of estimates with the x-axis clipped such that all estimates larger than 150,000 are not visible. 
 There were \Sexpr{format(sum(D$Schätzung>150000),big.mark=",")} estimates larger than 150,000 (\Sexpr{format(100*sum(D$Schätzung>150000)/nrow(D),digits=2)}\%) ranging from \Sexpr{format(min(D[D$Estimate>150000,"Estimate"]),big.mark=",")} to \Sexpr{format(max(D[D$Estimate>150000,"Estimate"]),big.mark=",")}.
 These large estimates (especially the maximal one) make the mean such a bad aggregation function in this case.  Nevertheless, even when these \Sexpr{format(sum(D$Schätzung>150000),big.mark=",")} values were removed the mean would be \Sexpr{format(round(mean(D$Estimate[D$Estimate<=150000])),big.mark=",")} and way too high.

\end{figure}

 Here, the median performs quite well, as in Galton's data. 
 The mean insteadt performs bad!
 A reason is that the distribution is heavily right-skew with a fat right tail.  
 This is typical for distributions when numbers are bounded by zero but span several orders of magnitude. 
 In this situation humans face a problem of logarithmic nature. 
 That means they firstly cope with finding the right magnitude. 
 Logarithmic thinking also seems to be the natural human intuition for mapping numbers to a line, while the linear mapping is a cultural invention needing formal education \parencite{Dehaene.Izard.ea2008LogorLinear}. 
 In these situation typically the logarithm of estimates looks more like a normal distribution. 
 Thus, the log-normal distribution is a better fitting distribution and the geometric mean\footnote{The geometric mean is the exponential of the arithmetic mean of the logarithmized sample data. } is a better measure of central tendency than the arithmetic mean. 
 The geometric mean is \Sexpr{format(exp(mean(log(D$Estimate))), digits=5,big.mark=",")} and thus only \Sexpr{format(truth-exp(mean(log(D$Estimate))), digits=3,big.mark=",")} less than the correct answer. 
 
 The former discussion gives rise to the claim that the shape of the distribution can advise the choice of the right measure of aggregation. Figure \ref{fig:WoCdistr} shows density estimates and best fits for a normal and a log-normal distribution for both samples. For Galton's data the normal distribution is the better fit according to all goodness-of-fit measures\footnote{All measures provided by \texttt{gofstat} in the R-package \texttt{fitdistr}.}. For the Viertelfest data instead the log-normal fit is better by all goodness-of-fit measures. 
 The median of a normally distributed random variable coincides with the arithmetic mean, while the median of a lognormally distributed random variable coincides with the geometric mean. This further underpins that the different choices of the arithmetic and the geometric mean for the two samples is quite reasonable. 
 
 Inference of the best measure of central tendency for the aggregation of the wisdom of the crowd from measurements of other aspects of the distribution is an interesting task, which needs further theoretical and empirical exploration. One way is to use the augmented quincunx model of sequential and probabilistic cue categorization presented by \textcite{Nash2014CuriousAnomalySkewed}. In particular, he argues that left-skewness in Galton's sample is due to the fact that most judgers had a lot of professional knowledge and the fact that the ox was comparably heavy. According to the theory, extremeness of the true value in comparison to a typical value known by judgers triggers a skew distribution, which is skew on the side of the typical and steep on the side of the extreme.  
 
 The set of options for measures of aggregtion is well described by \emph{abstract means} as outlined by \textcite{Hegselmann.Krause2005OpinionDynamicsDriven}\footnote{\textcite{Hegselmann.Krause2005OpinionDynamicsDriven} extend the concept to partial abstract means which they use to generalize bounded confidence models of opinion dynamics as treated in Chapter \ref{ch:od}. }. An abstract mean is a function which maps a set of real numbers to a certain number between the maximum and the minimum of that set.
 Within this framework it is always possible to find an abstract mean which aggregates the truth correctly as long as the truth is sandwiched between the minimal and the maximal estimate. 
 This excercise is of little practical relevance. 
 The real challenge is to infer a good generalized mean from the distribution of estimates without knowing the truth.

 An example for a sample of estimates which shows little crowd wisdom is another dataset collected by me on another occasion. At the ``Lange Nacht der Wissenschaft''\footnote{Literally ``Long Night of Science''} at Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg on September 24, 2010, I collected, with the help of others, estimates in a guestimation game\footnote{See a report in German here \url{http://janlo.de/wp/2010/09/07/schatzquiz-oldenburg/}. Link to the data: \url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bqe4yeb26lKIoaCqYfq4ZaK5jefSHGSRCpHlyWOiMQ4/edit?usp=sharing}} similar to the one of the Viertel-Fest. 
 Visitors were asked how many estimation tickets will be handed in between 17:00 and 20:00. 
<<OL-data,echo=FALSE>>=
O <- read.csv("R/ol_data.csv")
sO <- O[!is.na(O$Frage1),"Frage1"]
truth_O <- nrow(O)
powermean <- function(x,p) {
  if (p==0) {return(exp(mean(log(x),na.rm=T)))}
  else {return(mean(x^p, na.rm=T)^(1/p))}
}
@
 I collected \Sexpr{truth_O} tickets, that was the correct answer\footnote{For some reason, I reported 271 as the correct answer directly after the game. The reason is probably that I forgot to ultimately update the computation after entering the data from the final ticket. There was time pressure, because the winner had to be announced shortly after in the context of a science slam talk.}. From the tickets, I extracted \Sexpr{sum(!is.na(O$Frage1))} valid estimates which 5- to 95 percentile spanned values from \Sexpr{format(round(quantile(O$Frage1,0.05,na.rm=T)), big.mark=",")} to \Sexpr{format(round(quantile(O$Frage1,0.95,na.rm=T)), big.mark=",")}, and thus also almost three orders of magnitude. 
 The mean of estimates is \Sexpr{format(mean(O$Frage1,na.rm=T),digits=5,big.mark=",")}, the geometric mean is \Sexpr{format(exp(mean(log(O$Frage1),na.rm=T)),digits=4,big.mark=",")}, and the median is \Sexpr{format(median(O$Frage1,na.rm=T),big.mark=",")}. All are way to high compared to the true value. 
 Taking the median's closeness to the truth a good rough proxy for some crowd wisdom, we do not find much in this dataset. 
 The skewness and dispersion of the estimates over orders of magnitude is similar to the estimates from the Viertelfest. Thus, there is little indication coming from the data to use another aggregation function than the geometric mean, and it is reasonable to attribute this deviation to a systematic error caused by a collective cognitive bias to overestimate. 
 
 Nevertheless, there is an speculative interpretation of the estimation task which could give rise to another measure of aggregation which performs better. On the tickets, the time span 17:00-20:00 was clearly indicated. Based on this, we may interprete that people estimated how much time the collection takes per ticket. If we assume that people saw my three helpers and me, they might have thought about four times 180 minutes summing up to 720 collector minutes. The collection time per ticket was such 720/272 = 2.65 minutes. Estimates of 1000, or 5000 by other people would thus transform 720/1000=0.72 and 720/5000=0.14 minutes. With the assumption of this mindset, the arithmetic mean of these ratios might elicit some crowd wisdom, and the reciprocal value of this times 720 minutes would by the aggregation of crowd. This description coincides with taking the harmonic mean. The harmonic mean is the reciprocal value of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocal values of the sample data. The harmonic, the geometric and the arithmetic mean are special cases of $p$-means (also called power means or generalized means). \footnote{For positive numbers $x_1,\dots,x_n$ and a real number $p$, the $p$-mean is $(\frac{1}{n}\sum x_i^p)^\frac{1}{p}$. The arithmetic mean is represented by $p=1$, the harmonic mean by $p=-1$. The geometric mean appears as the limit for $p\to 0$. The minimum and the maximum are the limits for $p\to -\infty$ and $p\to\infty$ respectively. $p$-mean of the same sample are monotonously decreasing with $p$.}. The harmonic mean of the estimates of the number of tickets is \Sexpr{format(powermean(O$Frage1,-1),digits=4,big.mark=",")} and comes close to the true value of \Sexpr{truth_O}. This interpretation would also be valid for the number of lots at the Viertelfest, although it was not prominently communicated to participants. There is one very mild indication from data that a $p$-mean below the geometric mean should be used. In the Viertelfest data the median is at \Sexpr{format(100*median(D$Estimate)/powermean(D$Estimate,0),digits=3,big.mark=",")}\% of the geometric mean, while in the data from Oldenburg it is only at \Sexpr{format(100*median(O$Frage1,na.rm=T)/powermean(O$Frage1,0),digits=3,big.mark=",")}\%. As this is tiny and the median is also far away from the truth, it is more reasonable to assume that a systematic error is the reason. 
 
 Figure \ref{fig:OL} shows the histogram of estimates with the x-axis clipped such that all estimates larger than 5,000 are not visible. 
 There were \Sexpr{format(sum(O$Frage1>5000,na.rm=T),big.mark=",")} estimates larger than 5,000 (\Sexpr{format(100*sum(O$Frage1>5000,na.rm=T)/sum(!is.na(O$Frage1)),digits=2)}\%) ranging from \Sexpr{format(min(O[O$Frage1>5000,"Frage1"],na.rm=T),big.mark=",")} to \Sexpr{format(max(O[O$Frage1>5000,"Frage1"],na.rm=T),big.mark=",")}.

Not all samples of estimates for a particular judgment task can elicit wisdom of the crowd. Let us distinguish two extreme cases which can serve to assess when crowds are wise and when not. 
 \begin{compactenum}[(i)]
 \item When all individuals estimate correctly, then the crowd is not wiser than the individual. Thus, there is no crowd wisdom which goes beyond individual wisdom. More gradual version: If the sample's central tendancy is close to the truth but estimates show little dispersion, then there is not much crowd wisdom. 
 \item When the truth is not sandwiched between the minimal and maximal estimate, then there is no wisdom in the crowd but a systematic error in the sample. More gradual version: When every reasonable central tendency of the sample is far away from the truth, then there is no crowd wisdom. 
 \end{compactenum}
